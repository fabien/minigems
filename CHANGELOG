0.9.4 - 10/01/2008:
* Uses uses minigems/core (from the RubyGems patch).
* Refactored Gem.activate and Kernel#require - more robust matching of files.
* If a gem/required file cannot be found by minigems, as a last resort the
  full rubygems system and index is loaded.
* Set $MINIGEMS_DEBUG = true to see some details on when minigems switches to
  the full rubygems system.
* Will not try to load rubygems for dynamically created libs from RubyInline.
